  "short_desc": "The Daleks were a warrior race made up of genetically engineered mutants belonging to fundamental DNA type 467-989 who were originally from the planet Skaro.",
  "full_desc": "They were usually encased inside armour consisting of polycarbide and the metal Dalekanium. On many occasions, the Daleks openly acknowledged a single Time Lord, the Doctor, as their greatest enemy. The Doctor described them likewise, and his tenth incarnation stated that a Dalek was \"not just metal, it [was] alive,\" and that \"[i]nside that shell, there [was] a creature born to hate, whose only thought [was] to destroy everything and everyone that [wasn't] a Dalek, too.\"\n\nThe Daleks fought the Time Lords in the Last Great Time War, ending in the near-total destruction of the Dalek race. Intensely xenophobic and bent on universal domination, the Daleks were hated and feared throughout time and space. ",
