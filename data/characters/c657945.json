  "full_desc": "The Doctor is the last of an ancient, nearly God-like race called the Time Lords from the planet Gallifrey. He fled his home world with his granddaughter, Susan, to explore the universe. He travels in a living time machine known as the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which he stole from the Time Lords and which appears like a small London police box on the outside but which has nearly infinite dimensions on the inside. After some initial adventures with Susan in 1963 London, their odd lifestyle attracted the attention of two schoolteachers who forced their way into the TARDIS. The Doctor, wishing to keep secret his and Susan's existence, essentially kidnapped the teachers and took them on a number of adventures, eventually returning them and traveling with other companions, including, more recently, [Rose Tyler](/characters/c657946), [Amy Pond](/characters/c657947), [River Song](/characters/c657948), [Martha Jones](/characters/c657949) and [Donna Noble](/characters/c657950). He is described as the universes greatest defender and has saved it countless times from all manner of alien, war or other disaster. He shows a soft spot for humans.",
